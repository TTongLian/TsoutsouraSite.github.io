                    <h5>Caught with the Hand in the Cookie Jar: Firm Growth and Labor Reallocation after Exposure of Corrupt
                        Practices.
                    </h5>
                    <p>with Spyridon Lagaras and Jacopo Ponticelli</p>
                    <p>
                        <em>Abstract: </em>Corrupt practices in the assignment of government contracts are largely diffused and
                        can generate misallocation of resources across firms. We study how disclosure of such practices affects
                        firm growth and labor reallocation. We exploit exogenous variation in the exposure of corrupt firms
                        using random municipality audits by a large anti-corruption government program in Brazil. Firms exposed
                        by the auditing program experience a decline in employment growth relative to their peers. We document
                        that young, less-educated workers that do not occupy a managerial position have higher probability
                        to leave the exposed firms. Released workers tend to reallocate to smaller firms in the same sector
                        and municipality. Our evidence indicates that the exposure of corrupt practices reduces misallocation
                        of labor.</p>

                    <h5>Drivers of Effort: Evidence from Employee Absenteeism.
                    </h5>
                    <p>with M. Bennedsen and D. Wolfenzon </p>
                    <p>
                        <em>Abstract:</em> We use detailed information on individual absent spells of all employees in 2,600
                        firms in Denmark to document large differences across firms in average absenteeism. Using employees
                        who switch firms, we decompose absent days into an individual component (e.g., motivation, work ethic)
                        and a firm component (e.g., incentives, corporate culture). We find that the firm component explains
                        a large fraction of the difference in absenteeism across firms. We present suggestive evidence of
                        the mechanisms behind the firm effect. After controlling for selection of employees into firms, family
                        firm status and concentrated ownership are strongly correlated with decreases in absenteeism. Taken
                        together the evidence supports the importance of firm level mechanisms in eliciting effort from existing
                        employees.

                    <h5>Family Control and the Cost of Debt: Evidence from the Great Recession.
                    </h5>
                    <p>with Spyridon Lagaras</p>
                    <p>
                        <em>Abstract: </em>The purpose of the paper is to examine the effect of founding family control on the
                        cost of bank debt. We examine the cost of accessing the syndicated market and we use the financial
                        crisis and the unexpected nature of Lehman Brother's collapse as a laboratory in order to tease out
                        the effect of family ownership. We find that the increase in loan spreads around the Lehman crisis
                        was by at least 24 basis points lower for family firms. Furthermore, the gap in spreads among family
                        and non-family firms becomes wider among firms that had pre-crisis relationships with lenders with
                        higher exposure to the shock. The evidence are consistent with family ownership lowering the cost
                        of accessing debt financing especially when lenders are constrained. We further investigate potential
                        channels that drive the effect of family ownership. We provide novel evidence that for 17% of the
                        family firms creditors impose explicit restrictions in private credit agreements that require the
                        founding family to maintain a minimum percentage of ownership or voting power. Thus creditors value
                        the presence of the family. Furthermore, the impact of family control on lowering the cost of bank
                        debt is higher when family CEOs run the firms and among firms with higher ex ante agency conflicts.
